# Verification of SLSA provenance
This repository contains the implementation for verifying [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/). It currently supports verifying provenance generated by the [SLSA generator for Go projects](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator-go). We are working on support for verifying provenance for other ecosystems.

## Verification of Provenance

### Available options

Below is a list of options currently supported. Note that signature verification is handled seamlessly without the need for developers to manipulate public keys.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:slsa-framework/slsa-verifier.git
$ go run . --help
 Usage of ./slsa-verifier:
  -binary string
    	path to a binary to verify
  -branch string
    	expected branch the binary was compiled from (default "main")
  -provenance string
    	path to a provenance file
  -source string
    	expected source repository that should have produced the binary, e.g. github.com/some/repo
  -tag string
    	[optional] expected tag the binary was compiled from
  -versioned-tag string
    	[optional] expected version the binary was compiled from. Uses semantic version to match the tag
```

### Example

```bash
$ go run . --binary ~/Downloads/binary-linux-amd64 --provenance ~/Downloads/binary-linux-amd64.intoto.jsonl --source github.com/origin/repo
