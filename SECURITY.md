# Security Policy

The `slsa-verifier` community is committed to maintaining a secure-by-default verifier for SLSA.
If you believe you have identified a security issue in this project, please follow these guidelines for responsible disclosure.

## Supported Versions

You may report issues for the most recent version of `slsa-verifier`. We _may_, at our discretion, retroactively make changes to older, particularly unsupported versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue in this project, we kindly ask that you [privately report it](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). At the minimum, the report must contain the following:

* A description of the issue.
* A specific version or commit SHA of `slsa-verifier` where the issue reproduces.
* Instructions to reproduce the issue.

Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue or pull request to submit vulnerability reports. These public trackers are intended for non-time-sensitive and non-security-related bug reports and feature requests. Major feature requests, such as design changes to the specification, should be proposed to the [community](https://slsa.dev/community).
